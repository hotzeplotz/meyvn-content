Had to replace all the cello strings recently as, well, they should each have
been replaced long ago but they were all so unbearable. So i was imagining i
would have to either settle for cheap China-made filthy proxies of what could
be called string, or to spend a fortune on basic but honest strings - a full
set could be quite expensive.

After a little bit of searching online, i found a cheap set with good reviews,
allegedly made in the UK: ordered.

They were delivered today - not only they are made in the UK: they are real
"local produce" - made in Sevenoaks, Kent: basically, just round the corner.
