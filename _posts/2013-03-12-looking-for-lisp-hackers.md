> During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new
competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first
thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was
look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which
companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job
descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the
ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You
were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted
Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting
to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real
hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would
have been really worried.
                                                                                                                                                                        
(Paul Graham, [Beating the Averages](http://paulgraham.com/avg.html), 2001)

This was 2001, and still today, twelve years later, "*Oracle experience*"
seems to be valued broadly, appearing in over 2.5% of job postings
indexed on indeed.com, although in steady decline since mid-2011.

And this makes me think that all these companies still seeking
big-brand buzzword compliance today are stuck in another era, besides
being often held hostages by the pricing whims of said big brands.

It made me quite sad when i learnt, at a previous $job, that the IT
department's budget had to be adjusted recently, halting some plans to
develop new services for students, because of the impact of Oracle's
pricing rises on available money. Obviously Oracle's executives' fat
pockets need to be filled somehow, and it's Oracle's business to set
their pricing, but wasting money this way *can* indeed be avoided, by
stopping useless spending in proprietary products which are designed
to solve a cash problem (that of the companies' executives) rather
than a technical problem (which is, in the case of databases, solved
rather excellently by PostgreSQL and even Oracle's own MySQL in the
relational field and by MongoDB and countless other projects in the
NoSQL field).
